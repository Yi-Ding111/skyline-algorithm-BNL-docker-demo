# Skyline algorithm by Block Nested loop (docker demo)

This project is a skyline algorithm based on Block Nested loop from scratch. It is used to find NBA players who are in domination in different positions. 

I also show a docker demo here (including dockerfile, build image and run container). It is allow us to run .py file if you do not have python env. 

Feel free to use it to learn about skyline algorithm or simple docker CMD.
